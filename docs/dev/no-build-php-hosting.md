# No-Build PHP Hosting (F5.21)

A PHP project with no `composer.json` and no `buildCmd` now deploys the same
way HestiaCP/CyberPanel/cPanel work — files go straight into a running
PHP-FPM pool, no build step — generalizing F5.7's WordPress two-container
(PHP-FPM + nginx) pattern instead of WordPress's fixed official image. A PHP
project that *does* have a `composer.json` is unaffected and keeps building
via Nixpacks exactly as before.

## Why

Nixpacks' own PHP provider only recognizes a project as PHP when it finds a
`composer.json` **or** an `index.php`. Vexlyx's own detection
(`detect_php_project` in `build_manager.py`) is more lenient — it also
accepts bare `.php` files with no framework/dependencies — so a project like
a Duplicator (WordPress migration) backup (`installer.php` + a site `.zip`,
no `composer.json`) passed Vexlyx's detection but failed Nixpacks' real build
with "unable to generate a build plan."

## Extensions: a custom `vexlyx-php-fpm` image

The official `php:8.3-fpm-alpine` base is bare — no `mysqli`, `zip`, `gd`,
`mbstring`, etc. Rather than ship that directly or install extensions at
every container start, Vexlyx builds a small custom image once at install
time:

- **`docker/php-fpm/Dockerfile`** — `php:8.3-fpm-alpine` +
  `mysqli pdo_mysql zip gd exif mbstring intl` via `docker-php-ext-install`.
  `zip` in particular is required for the Duplicator case itself — the
  migration archive is extracted by PHP, not by Vexlyx.
- Built by `system/scripts/install/steps/10-images.sh` as `vexlyx-php-fpm:8.3`,
  the same pattern already used for `vexlyx-ufw-helper` (F5.4).
- Configurable via `PHP_FPM_IMAGE` (`apps/api/src/config/env.ts`, default
  `vexlyx-php-fpm:8.3`) if an operator wants to swap in their own image.

PHP version is fixed at 8.3 for this path — one baked image, no per-project
version selection, matching WordPress's fixed `wordpress:php8.3-fpm-alpine`.
Nixpacks-built PHP (`composer.json` present) is unaffected and keeps its
existing per-project version detection (`detect_php_version`).

## Compose shape

`system/templates/docker-compose/php-no-build.yml` — two services, modeled
on `wordpress.yml`'s shape but bind-mounting the project's own source
directory instead of a named volume:

- **`app`** (PHP-FPM): `{{php_root}}:/var/www/html`, **read-write**. Unlike
  STATIC's read-only bind mount, this has to be writable — a self-installing
  script like Duplicator's `installer.php` extracts its archive and writes
  its own files into the docroot as part of running. A read-only mount would
  make that fail outright.
- **`web`** (nginx, Traefik-facing): same directory, `:ro` — nginx only ever
  reads. This read-write/read-only asymmetry mirrors `wordpress.yml`'s `app`
  vs `web` volumes exactly.

## Nginx config

`system/templates/nginx/php.conf.template` falls back unmatched URIs to
`index.php`, the standard front-controller pattern most real PHP apps need:

```
location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args; }
location ~ \.php$ { fastcgi_pass {{app_upstream}}:9000; ... }
```

This was originally a hard `=404` instead — deliberately *not* a
WordPress-style rewrite, reasoning that arbitrary PHP entry files (like
Duplicator's `installer.php`) should be servable directly by URL rather than
silently redirected. That reasoning was wrong in practice: `try_files`
already matches a real file (`installer.php`) on its *first* check and never
reaches the `index.php` fallback, so direct-file access was never actually at
risk. Meanwhile the hard `=404` broke the far more common case — a real
WordPress site (e.g. migrated in-place by Duplicator) needs pretty permalinks
like `/about-page/` to resolve through `index.php`, and those aren't real
files/directories on disk. Found live: `wp-login.php` worked (a real file)
but every pretty-permalink page 404'd. A project with no `index.php` at all
still gets a clean 404 for a missing path, via the `.php` location's own
`try_files $uri =404;` guard.

`client_max_body_size 512m` — higher than WordPress's 64m, since migration
archives run larger.

The `web` healthcheck (`wget ... ; test $$? -ne 4`) treats a reachable-but-404
response as healthy — there's no guaranteed index page for an arbitrary PHP
project, so only an actual connection failure (exit 4) counts as unhealthy.

## Four bugs found live, testing a real Duplicator migration

The synthetic single-`index.php` test that shipped with this feature didn't
catch any of these — they only surfaced running a real ~26k-file WordPress
migration through Duplicator. All four are fixed in the templates below;
`docs/dev/` is the record of *why*, since none of this is obvious from
reading the config alone.

**1. `fastcgi_read_timeout` (60s default) killed the migration extraction.**
Duplicator's AJAX-chunked extraction of 25,760 files ran past nginx's default
60s fastcgi timeout, surfacing to the browser as `AJAX ERROR! STATUS: 504`.
Fixed by setting `fastcgi_connect_timeout`/`fastcgi_send_timeout`/
`fastcgi_read_timeout` to `300s` in `php.conf.template` — this feature exists
specifically for long-running migration-style work, so a generous timeout is
the correct default here, not a special case.

**2. PHP never sees `$_SERVER['HTTPS']`, so WordPress redirect-loops on
`wp-login.php`.** Traefik terminates TLS at the edge and always proxies to
the `web` (nginx) container over plain HTTP — nginx→PHP-FPM is plain HTTP
too. PHP has no way to know the original request was HTTPS unless told, so
`is_ssl()` always returns false. A migrated site with an `https://` `siteurl`
(or any app enforcing HTTPS on login/admin) redirects to `https://` on every
request, and since PHP still thinks it's HTTP next time, it redirects again —
forever. Fixed with the standard reverse-proxy recipe: a `map
$http_x_forwarded_proto $fastcgi_https` block translating Traefik's
(correctly-sent) `X-Forwarded-Proto` header into the `HTTPS` fastcgi param
PHP actually checks. Applied to **both** `php.conf.template` and
`wordpress.conf.template` — F5.7's WordPress path has the exact same latent
bug, just never hit it because nothing forced an HTTPS-only redirect before.

**3. Docker Compose auto-aliases `app`/`web` on the *shared* `traefik-net`
network, so two two-container projects collide.** This is the serious one.
Every compose template names its services `app`/`web` — a Compose-generated
alias `app` therefore gets registered on `traefik-net` for *every* project
that has an `app` service, but `traefik-net` is one shared external network
across the whole install, not scoped per project. With two no-build PHP (or
WordPress) projects deployed at once, `fastcgi_pass app:9000` resolves
**ambiguously** — Docker's embedded DNS round-robins between both projects'
`app` containers, so nginx randomly proxies PHP execution to a *different
project's* php-fpm container. Confirmed live with `getent hosts app` from
inside one project's `web` container returning the other project's IP, and
`index.php`/`wp-login.php` requests alternating between two completely
different responses request-by-request. This is a cross-tenant correctness
bug, not just a flaky one.

  Fixed by addressing each project's `app` container by its own unique,
  Compose-generated container name (`vexlyx-<service_name>-app-1`, deterministic
  from the compose project's `name:` field + service name) instead of the
  ambiguous bare service name. `docker_manager.py`'s `cmd_deploy` computes
  `app_upstream = f"vexlyx-{service_name}-app-1"` and `generate_nginx_conf`
  now accepts placeholder substitution (previously it just copied the
  template verbatim) so `{{app_upstream}}` can be injected into both
  `php.conf.template` and `wordpress.conf.template`.

  This bug applies to WordPress (F5.7) as much as no-build PHP (F5.21) — any
  Vexlyx install running 2+ WordPress and/or no-build-PHP projects
  simultaneously was exposed before this fix. `web`'s alias has the identical
  collision but is harmless today, since nothing resolves `web` by DNS name
  (Traefik discovers containers via Docker labels, not internal DNS).

**4. Pretty permalinks (`/about-page/`) 404'd even though the migration
succeeded.** `location /` originally hard-404'd anything that wasn't a real
file/directory, on the reasoning that an arbitrary PHP entry file (like
`installer.php`) should be servable directly by URL rather than silently
rewritten. That reasoning didn't hold up: `try_files` already matches a real
file on its first check, so direct-file access was never actually at risk;
meanwhile the hard `=404` broke the much more common case of an actual
WordPress site, whose non-file URLs need to resolve through `index.php`.
Fixed by changing `location /` to the standard `try_files $uri $uri/
/index.php?$args;` front-controller fallback — verified this doesn't
regress direct file access (`installer.php` still serves directly) or a
genuinely-missing file (`.php` location's own `try_files $uri =404;` guard
still 404s cleanly when there's no `index.php` to fall back to either).

## Wiring: `docker_manager.py` / `build_manager.py`

- **Deploy-time template selection** (`cmd_deploy` in `docker_manager.py`):
  the API service signals "this is a no-build PHP deploy" the exact same way
  it already signals no-build STATIC/REACT — by passing `staticRoot` in the
  deploy payload. When `projectType == "PHP"` and `staticRoot` is present,
  `cmd_deploy` swaps in `php-no-build.yml` and generates `php.conf.template`
  instead of the default `php.yml` (single-container, Nixpacks-built image).
- **`primary_service_name(project_type, compose_dir)`**: WORDPRESS is always
  a two-container split (`web` fronts traffic). PHP is now ambiguous —
  Nixpacks-built PHP is a single `app` container, no-build PHP is `app` +
  `web` — so `project_type` alone can't disambiguate a *redeploy's*
  status/logs/container-id lookup. Instead of persisting a new flag, this
  inspects the already-generated `<projectDir>/deploy/docker-compose.yml` for
  a top-level `web:` service key.
- **`build/service.ts`**: `isPhpNoBuild = effectiveProjectType === "PHP" &&
  !effectiveBuildCmd`, alongside the existing `isStaticNoBuild`/`isWordPress`
  checks — skips `runBuildImage` entirely and sets `staticRoot = projectDir`.
- **`deploy/service.ts`**: the independent "redeploy without rebuild" path
  (`DeployService.deploy`) gets the same `project.type === "PHP" &&
  !project.buildCmd` check, mirroring its existing STATIC/REACT branch.
- **`build_manager.py`'s composer.json stopgap** (auto-writing an empty
  `composer.json` so Nixpacks can build a composer-less PHP project) is now
  fallback-only: since the no-build path is taken automatically whenever
  there's no `composer.json`/`buildCmd`, `cmd_build` is never invoked for
  that case at all. The stopgap only still matters if a user explicitly
  forces a `buildCmd` override on a composer-less PHP project.

## Known caveat

A project that already had the stopgap `composer.json` auto-written to its
source directory (from before this feature shipped) won't pick up the
no-build path until that file is removed — detection is purely
`composer.json`-presence-based, with no distinction between a "real"
`composer.json` and Vexlyx's own stopgap-written empty one.

## Testing

1. Deploy a project with a single `index.php` and no `composer.json` → no
   Nixpacks build logged, container up in low single-digit seconds.
2. Deploy a Duplicator-style package (`installer.php` + `.zip`, no
   `composer.json`) → installer runs and successfully writes into the
   docroot.
3. Deploy a PHP project with a real `composer.json` (e.g. Laravel) → still
   builds via Nixpacks, unaffected.
4. Redeploy a no-build PHP project (no rebuild) → reuses the bind mount
   without invoking Nixpacks.
5. `docker compose logs`/status/stop/start against a no-build PHP project →
   `primary_service_name` correctly resolves to `web`.
