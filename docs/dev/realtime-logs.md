# F1.6 — Real-Time Logs

## What This Feature Does

F1.6 adds a Socket.io–based real-time log streaming layer to Vexlyx. Two log streams are supported:

1. **Build logs** — emitted line-by-line as `nixpacks build` runs inside the BullMQ worker. Any subscribed frontend tab receives each line instantly without polling.
2. **Runtime logs** — streamed from a live `docker logs --follow` subprocess when the "Runtime Logs" panel is open in the dashboard.

## Architecture

```
Browser (Socket.io client)
        │
        │  WebSocket (cookie auth)
        ▼
Fastify HTTP server
        │
        ├── plugins/socket.ts       ← Socket.io server + session auth
        │
        ├── modules/logs/
        │   ├── service.ts          ← replay, streaming, event handlers
        │   └── routes.ts           ← wires handlers into Fastify
        │
        └── modules/build/service.ts
                └── appendLog()     ← emits log:build after each DB write
```

### Socket.io Rooms

| Room | Who joins | Events received |
|---|---|---|
| `deployment:{id}` | Client via `subscribe:build` | `log:history` (on join), `log:build` (live) |
| `container:{projectId}` | Client via `subscribe:runtime` | `log:runtime`, `log:runtime:error` |

### Authentication

Every Socket.io connection is authenticated in the `io.use()` middleware inside `plugins/socket.ts`. The session cookie (`vexlyx_session`) is parsed from the handshake headers and looked up in Redis — identical to the REST auth flow in `plugins/auth.ts`. Unauthenticated connections are rejected immediately.

## How to Test

### 1. Build log streaming
1. Open a project page in the dashboard
2. Click **Deploy**
3. Expand the new deployment row
4. Watch build log lines appear in real-time as nixpacks runs — no polling, no refresh

### 2. Build log replay
1. Navigate away from a completed deployment's project page
2. Navigate back and expand that deployment
3. Full build log should appear immediately (replayed from DB on room join)

### 3. Runtime logs
1. A container must be running (`containerStatus: running`)
2. Click **Runtime Logs** in the Live Container card
3. New container output appears live — auto-scrolls to bottom
4. Scroll up manually — a "scroll paused" banner appears
5. Click the banner (or the ▶ button) — auto-scroll resumes

### 4. stderr filter
1. Click the **Filter** (funnel) icon in any LogViewer header
2. Only lines with `[vexlyx:error]` / stderr stream are shown
3. Click again to restore all streams

### 5. Auth guard
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Confirm the Socket.io WebSocket connection sends the `vexlyx_session` cookie
- A request without the cookie will be rejected by the server with an `UNAUTHORIZED` error event

## How to Extend

### Add a new log source
1. Define a new Socket.io room name (e.g., `nginx:{projectId}`)
2. Add `subscribe:nginx` / `unsubscribe:nginx` handlers in `logs/service.ts`
3. Add the corresponding `useNginxLogs()` hook in `useLogs.ts` following the `useRuntimeLogs` pattern
4. Render with `<LogViewer lines={...} title="Nginx Logs" isLive isConnected={...} />`

### Change the line cap
The 1000-line cap is defined as `MAX_LINES = 1000` at the top of `hooks/useLogs.ts`. Change it there — no API changes needed.

### Make LogViewer taller/shorter
Pass a different `maxHeightClass` prop — e.g., `maxHeightClass="max-h-[60vh]"`.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Styled `<pre>` instead of xterm.js | Logs are read-only; xterm.js is built for interactive shells and adds ~300KB. The pre approach is consistent with existing Vexlyx UI patterns. |
| Frontend-only 1000-line cap | DB keeps the full log for audit purposes. Truncating at write time is destructive. The client caps for render performance. |
| `docker logs --follow` via Python daemon | Consistent with existing `runDockerAction` / `runDockerStatus` architecture. Avoids direct Docker socket exposure (CLAUDE.md §6). |
| Singleton socket client | One WebSocket connection for the entire app lifetime, ref-counted. Prevents duplicate connections when multiple log panels are open simultaneously. |
| Room-per-deployment model | Isolates events so a user watching deployment A never receives events from deployment B. Ownership is verified server-side before join is allowed. |
